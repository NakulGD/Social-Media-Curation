# socialmediatwitter CPEN221 Class Project

This project is a messaging and content curation service for people to interact with content on Twitter.
We have built a time-sensitive queuing data structure and used it to implement a publish-subscribe model for data sharing. 
We've used Twitter API to access and port content into your service and made our service accessible to users by implementing a client-server paradigm.
We have also incorporated basic cryptographic schemes to ensure a degree of security.
